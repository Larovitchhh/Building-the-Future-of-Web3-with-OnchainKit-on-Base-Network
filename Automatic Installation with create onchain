For developers starting a new project, OnchainKit provides a streamlined setup process using the npm create onchain command. This command bootstraps a new onchain app with all necessary dependencies and pre-configured templates, saving weeks of setup time. To create a project, run:bash

npm create onchain@latest

This command prompts you to enter a project name and your Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Client API Key. Once completed, it generates a project folder with the following out-of-the-box features:Next.js v14 with App routing for modern web development.
Ethereum L2 Support through Base, ensuring low-cost transactions.
Smart Wallet Integration for easy account creation and gasless transactions.
Tailwind CSS for modern styling best practices.
Linting, Formatting, and Tests for easy maintenance.

Pre-built templates are also available for specific use cases, such as:Onchain Commerce

After setup, navigate to your project directory, install dependencies, and run the development server:bash

cd your-project-name
npm install
npm run dev
